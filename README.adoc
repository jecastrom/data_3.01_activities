== Get the number of clients by district, returning district name

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql

    b.A2 AS district_name,
    count(a.client_id) AS number_of_clients
FROM

== Move all clients from `Strakonice` to a new district with `district_id = 100`

`*_Answer:_*`

First I will insert a new district on the district table named `New Strakonice` with district_id = 100 and roughly half of the values:

```sql
INSERT INTO
    district
VALUES
    (
        100,
        'New Strakonice',
        'south Bohemia',
        35323,
        47,
        7,
        1,
        1,
        2,
        29.2,
        8541,
        1.32,
        1.82,
        60,
        781,
        771
    );
```

Checking the insert with a select statement:

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    district
WHERE
    a1 = 100;
```

Next I update the `district_id` column on the `client` table only for those customers with the `district_id` = 20 which is `Strakonice`:


```sql
UPDATE
    `client`
SET
    district_id = 100
WHERE
    district_id = 20;
```

== How would you spot clients with wrong or missing `district_id`?

`*_Answer:_*`

_To spot clients with missing `district_id`: (I have inserted a customer with a null district_id). It is important to also look for empty spaces (`' '`). However as empty spaces are strings, it does not apply to the district_id column as the data type of this column is `int`._

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    bank.client
WHERE
    district_id IS NULL;
```

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63274055/149675647-3b742c85-ac43-4975-8aeb-bf4991f014cf.png[width=600]

_To spot clients with the wrong `district_id` we have to consider the following:_

_In this database, there are no enforced relationships between the tables with foreign keys. In the `client` table, the `district_id` column is independent from the `A1` column on the `district` table which holds the district_id, so there is redundancy of data here. So the district_id's are 77, from 1 to 77._
_If there was a typo or an error on the client record, and the error lies from the range between 1 to 77, there is no way to spot the error._

_However, if the error lies outside this range (between 1 to 77), we can spot the error with the following query:_

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    client
WHERE
    district_id NOT IN (
        SELECT
            a1
        FROM
            district
    );
```

_If the district_id were a foreign key from A1, the update with a typo would have not occurred because of the foreign key constrains._

_to check for `errors` and `null` values:_

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    client
WHERE
    district_id IS NULL
    OR district_id NOT IN (
        SELECT
            a1
        FROM
            district
    );
```
